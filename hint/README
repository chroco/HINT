HINT, distribution for Craig Files and Claude Sammut

Directories:

src           includes sources for hint, to compile on Sun, use
              make, to compile on other machines (SGI, HP) edit makefile
              and change MACHINE variable

              makefile (if successful) produces the executable hint

gen           a perl script that produces some very simple hint scripts
              with example functions. Try, for example

              gen -fb0 > funct.s
              src/hint -c funct.s

              For description of which functions it can produce, type

              gen

doc           some documentation
doc/doc.ps    a very old and almost useless documentation on hint (in
              those times it was called sds). A much better
              documentation on principles how HINT works is available on
              
              http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/papers.html

              In particular, see ICML-97 paper, IEEE Expert
	      forthcoming paper, and Zupan's Thesis (this one
	      especially for noise handling)

examples      some more complex examples, try

              ../src/hint -c car.s               (car with no noise)
              ../src/hint -c nursery.s           (nursery with no noise)
              ../src/hint -c car_noise.s         (car with 30% noise)

              To change the number of examples used for learning,
              change the percentage in

              split 30% of tmp to y and tmp1

              to some other value (file act.s for car and nursery,
              file car_noise_act.s for noisy car which uses
              50%). Noise in car is added artificially (see
              car_noise_act.s), currently, 30% of noise is added to
              learning examples. If HINT runs properly on the later
              case, it should output

              of 865 different 36 (  4.16%) def 0(right 0)

	      which basically means that of remaining 50% examples in
	      test set only 4.16% are misclassified.
